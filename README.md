# Let's Go!
Let's Go! is a Group Trip Budgeting and Planning Application for friends who are want to plan and budget a trip together built using React.js + Redux with a Ruby on Rails [backend API](https://github.com/cStruong/letsgo_back).

## Introduction
Let's Go! is my Capstone Project inspired to solve a problem me and my friends had while planning a group trip. We originally used a spreadsheet to plan a trip but quickly found it to be difficult and tedious. I created Let's Go to be a platform where individuals can plan and budget a trip together.
